- one can use git to fetch the source code from github to the VM
- server files can by anywhere, eg Applications/..., static files should be put in web folders so they are served by apache
(it's best this way, and the only way to comply with the rules. node cannot bind to 8080 port so the link will not work without adding 3000)
(this is not a problem for client calls to API, just use correct url)

- node needs to be updated(installed) to the latest version
sudo npm cache clean -f
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n stable

Alternative way to fix this thing:
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_5.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

- couch db needs to be installed ( and configured to accept connections only from localhost )
sudo apt-get install curl
sudo apt-get install couchdb
curl localhost:5984

- node server can be started with node server.js, if no errors, all good
or if installed with nodejs, then nodejs server.js

- API keys need to be manually added to the file on the VM
